# Canvas Transfer — iPad test app

A small iPad app that tests the three things the Python prototype can't:

1. **Live rectangle detection** — Apple Vision outlines the canvas or paper in
   the camera view, and finds the corners again on the photo you take.
2. **Pencil and touch** — dragging corners with a loupe, and moving, pinching
   and twisting a reference into place.
3. **Color on the iPad** — a canvas photo with a reference at Multiply 60 %
   (with auto levels) on top, opacity, and full screen.

It is not the app: nothing is saved, there is no iCloud, Color tools, Compare,
crop or undo. Names and defaults follow `docs/design/README.md`.

## Run it on your iPad

Needs Xcode 16 or later (the project uses folder-synced groups) and an iPad on
iPadOS 17 or later.

1. Open `ios/CanvasTransferTest/CanvasTransferTest.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Select the **CanvasTransferTest** target → **Signing & Capabilities**:
   - **Team**: your Apple ID (Xcode → Settings → Accounts to add it; a free
     account works, the app then runs for 7 days before you reinstall it).
   - **Bundle Identifier**: change `com.example.CanvasTransferTest` to
     something of your own, e.g. `com.yourname.CanvasTransferTest`.
3. Connect the iPad with a cable, unlock it, and trust the Mac. The first time,
   turn on **Settings → Privacy & Security → Developer Mode** on the iPad and
   restart it.
4. Choose the iPad as the run destination at the top of the Xcode window and
   press **Run** (⌘R). The first time, the iPad may ask you to trust the
   developer: **Settings → General → VPN & Device Management**.

The Simulator runs it too, but has no camera: use **Photos** there.

New `.swift` files dropped into `CanvasTransferTest/` are picked up by Xcode
automatically.

## What to try

- **Camera** (left strip): point at the canvas on the easel. Does the blue
  outline find it — in studio light, at an angle, with a busy background?
  Note when it fails.
- Take the photo: are the corners already right? Drag them — is the loupe
  where you need it, with finger and with Pencil?
- **Add layer** as Canvas, then Camera again for a drawing as Reference (the
  camera offers them in that order). The reference lands at Multiply 60 %
  with Transform on: one finger moves it, pinch scales, twist rotates.
- Compare the colors with the Mac prototype and with the real canvas.
- **Full screen** (top right) for working at the easel; the faint button
  top-left comes back.
- Photos (left strip) adds a canvas photo or reference from your library.
